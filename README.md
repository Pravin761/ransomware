Ransomware
### Purpose of This Code:

1. **Malicious Intent (Hypothetical):**  
   This type of code is often used by attackers to decrypt files after a ransomware attack, once the victim pays the ransom (e.g., in Bitcoin) and the attacker provides the correct decryption key.

2. **Complementary Role:**  
   It is designed to work as the counterpart of the encryption code. Files encrypted by the initial ransomware code can only be decrypted using this script with the same original key.

2. **Ethical Use:**  
   If you are writing such code for **educational** or **research** purposes, ensure it is done in a secure and isolated environment. This prevents misuse and aligns with ethical guidelines.
